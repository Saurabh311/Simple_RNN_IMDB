# IMDB Sentiment Analysis with Simple RNN

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://ann-classification-churn-mnadekm8dmdxpvncujaht5.streamlit.app/)

A sentiment analysis project that classifies IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative using a Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) implemented with TensorFlow/Keras.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates:
- Text preprocessing for NLP tasks
- Building a Simple RNN model for binary classification
- Training and evaluating on the IMDB reviews dataset
- Deploying the model as an interactive web app using Streamlit

## Requirements

To run this project locally, you'll need:

- Python 3.9-3.11 (TensorFlow 2.x is not yet fully compatible with Python 3.12)
- TensorFlow 2.15.0 or higher
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
